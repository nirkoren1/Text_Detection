# Scene OCR


This project aims to develop a model for detecting text regions within scene images and recognize the words.

## Key Features:
* Employs a VGG-based convolutional neural network architecture for feature extraction.
* The model uses segmentation for detecting text regions.
* Processes images of varying dimensions by padding and resizing.
* The r

## Additional Information:
* Dataset: The project currently utilizes the TextOCR dataset from Kaggle.
